# Distributed Programming

Distributed systems are a group of computers working for the same task. It is the opposite of centralized systems which are simpler but they lack 2 essential factors:

1. Scalability: Because when you need more of something, you can just add another computer to the network, with centralized computing, you have a limit on how much you can upgrade.
2. Reliability: Because there are many computers working on the same task, if one of them fails, the other computers can compensate.

Distributed systems are more complex

## Examples

1. DNS Server
2. Big websites such as Facebook, Google or Twitter

When the A/C system fails in a car, it doesn't stop working.

## Characteristics

1. Concurrent work: Devices do different tasks at the same time with one shared goal.
2. Scalability: Each machine is capable to work indepently
3. Fail tolerancy: Redundancy and software backup. Computers fail independently
4. Transparency: The system works as one. 
5. Execution times: Each task is independant, it is later syncronized because there is no global clock.
6. High cost
7. Software not yet standarized
8. Needs rigurous security work

## Why is it useful

Share resources and distribute data and processing power.

## Kinds

1. Computing
   1. Clúster: Connected PC's with a high speed network. Every node executes the same SO
   2. Grid: BIGGER, different hardware and software

## Structure

Users
Apps
Services
Kernel
Hardware

## Arquitecture

1. Multiprocessor
2. Client-Server
3. Distributed objects

## Middleware
Software to link apps or devices and interact between them
